# Plane3D

The code is written by Majid Masoumi @ dr.majid.masoumi@gmail.com
Building a plane with two parameters: a normal and a point.

The code does the following steps:

1 – Writing a class Plane() that represents a plane with two parameters: a normal and a point.

2 – Adding a method to the class Plane() that returns the parameters a, b, c, d of the plane equation ax + by + cz + d = 0.

3 – Adding a method to the class that takes as input a point in the form (x, y, z) and returns the distance of the point to the plane.
